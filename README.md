DATA PREPROCESSING

In a dataset with a small dimension, empty values were removed from the dataset.

CORRELATION ANALYSIS

A correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between the variables. Based on the information presented in the visualization, columns with no correlation were removed from the dataset. The columns "Total Cup Points" and "Overall" with the highest correlation rate were selected as the dependent and independent variables, respectively, for the Linear Regression model.
